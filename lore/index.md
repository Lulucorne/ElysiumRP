  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Most residents of Knox County found it easy to ignore the world unraveling around them, the news blared with a cacophony of mindless weather, politics, and the same late-night TV hosts talking about the political state of the nation. Hosts cue their audiences to laugh about how President Brandenburg plans to curb the wild animal attacks spreading across social media. Reports then turned towards the rising animal rights protests across the nation, supporting or decrying the government's use of force on animal populations. Meanwhile, the average consumer carried on with their daily activities, desensitised to the constant feed of breaking news.</p>

  <p>Statewide Emergency Broadcasts claimed that the outbreak had been contained to the tri-state area. But fear persisted, especially after mainstream media, focused on Kentucky, reported what became known as the <em>“Paradise Pond Homeless Camp Massacre.”</em> The sole survivor, believed to be responsible, was arrested and died in custody. The cause of death reported: Rabies. Life went on, even as public debate raged over the details of the massacre. Isolated events of rabid violence and the resulting panic were broadcast over breaking news stories on televisions across the state as families barricaded themselves into their homes. Then came the travel bans, an omen of times to come. Borders were closing, trapping those inside. The only hope was that the outbreak could be contained for the sake of everyone else.</p>

  <p>Things have gone from bad to worse. Worries about climate change and terrorists now seem trivial as the government begins quarantining the South, almost as if cutting off its own leg to survive. When the world’s leading power panicked, the public followed, turning on one another in fear of what a government withdrawal might bring. The latest news from Kentucky focuses on evacuation points, offering a slim chance to escape before the authorities pull out completely. For those with enough sense and resources, the journey had already begun. Now, heading toward these points, hope glimmers on the horizon, but whether it will lead to safety or disappointment remains uncertain.</p>

  <h2>Timeline</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>October 2015, early on:</strong> An uptick in the news of “rabid animals” and advisory on to be safe; it's easy enough to brush off as yet another minor advisory.</li>
    <li><strong>November 2015:</strong> News reports on a rise of animal protestors in response to the government's action of trying to take animals off the streets.</li>
    <li><strong>December 2015:</strong> The Paradise Pond Homeless Camp Massacre: local news report about a camp of homeless people that were massacred. One survivor remained but was arrested with claims of him being the maniac that did it. A “rabies infection event” is what's claimed. This piece of news is not as easy to brush off.</li>
    <li><strong>February 2016:</strong> A new mystery disease and symptoms become more prevalent in humans which would escalate to even more advisories being sent out, media battle between “what is true and what is a cover-up”. Unease within the people continues to rise. Alleged symptoms include disorientation, fever, fatigue/weakness, and general memory loss at first.</li>
    <li><strong>April 2016:</strong> Travel ban has been implemented from foreign countries with concerns of the illness spreading more overseas. Countries begin to place travel bans, forbidding any external visitors to enter the land.</li>
    <li><strong>June 2016:</strong> Medication is developed, <em>Nexaphen</em>, in response to the rising illness. It puts people at ease but barely, there's still demands of truth. What's really happening? Why are we advised to stay in our homes? What happened to those homeless people and the one survivor?</li>
    <li><strong>September 2016:</strong> Warnings of mosquito and sanitation trucks being sent out more often in response to illness rising, advisory to stay indoors more often is repeated. Rumors of a “quarantine” being put in place causes even more people to riot; protests turn violent at the egging of opportunistic people.</li>
    <li><strong>November 2016:</strong> A general quarantine at home is issued across the south, to much dissatisfaction of the populace, confirming the earlier rumors. Those within the region are asked to avoid interactions with unknown individuals, as there are potentially hostile individuals roaming the streets. Likewise, people are instructed to only risk going outside only in an emergency or when authorities distribute aid.</li>
    <li><strong>December 2016:</strong> Federal presence within the southern United States has grown strained and a breakdown of societal order has begun to occur in the area. Reports and updates have become more sporadic and dire about the conditions seen within the region, describing it almost akin to what was seen in hurricane Katrina but on a wider and larger scale.</li>
    <li><strong>January 2017:</strong> The United States government issues a region-wide evacuation as pressure to contain the outbreak to the southern United States is starting to  strain. Outbreaks have begun to occur north of the Ohio river and west of the Mississippi, as such federal forces have been ordered to evacuate non-infected citizens where possible, before attempting to pull out themselves.</li>
