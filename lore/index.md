<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Elysium Roleplay</strong> strives to maintain a ruleset that grows with its community. Staff encourage players to ask questions and submit feedback regarding rules that are unclear or harmful to the player experience.</p>

  <p>Likewise, players must be aware that Elysium Roleplay’s rules may change at any time. Stay up to date with rule changes by checking the server announcements!</p>

  <p>We understand that everyone makes mistakes, but “I didn’t know” will never be an acceptable excuse for breaking the rules!</p>

  <p><em>Last rule update: October 15th, 2025</em></p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Community Conduct</h2>
  <p><strong>[1.1] All players are expected to treat other community members with respect.</strong> Elysium aims to maintain a welcoming,  inclusive, and fair atmosphere with zero tolerance for bullying, intentional provocation, rumors, or cheating. <u>Players of detriment to Elysium’s community values may be removed, transparently, at the staff team’s discretion.</u></p>

  <p><strong>[1.2] Hate speech or the use of slurs are not allowed in any Elysium medium.</strong> We have a zero tolerance policy for discrimination regarding gender, race, orientation, or religion. Breach of this rule is grounds for immediate and permanent removal from the server.</p>

  <p><strong>[1.3] NSFW images and discussions are not allowed in any Elysium medium.</strong> Although we are an 18+ community, Elysium strives to keep its focus on collaborative storytelling and remain inclusive of those uncomfortable with sexual topics.</p>

  <p><strong>[1.4] Understand that staff have the final say on all disputes.</strong> In the interest of fairness, the Elysium staff team guarantees individual staff members will never rule on their own tickets, PK requests, etc.</p>

  <p><strong>[1.5] All Elysium players are bound to a three-strike system.</strong> As a general guideline, most rulebreaks result in one strike against the player’s record. Egregious offenses, however, may warrant two or even three strikes (an instant ban) at staff discretion.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Roleplay Conduct</h2>
  <p><strong>[2.1] Understand the difference between In-character [IC] and Out-of-character [OOC].</strong> “In-character” refers to the speech and actions of roleplay characters and, in regards to Elysium, refers to anything in-game or the IC section of the Discord. “Out-of-character” refers to the speech and actions of the real people behind these characters. Understand that players are not their characters; the speech and actions of roleplay characters must not be judged as the beliefs and behaviors of those playing them.</p>

  <p><strong>[2.2] Elysium allows both text-based RP and voice RP [VoIP].</strong> Players may switch between text and voice RP at will and are expected to include both styles of players; this extends to keeping the chat window enabled as much as possible during play. <em>Note: PvP initiations must be made over text.</em></p>

  <p><strong>[2.3] All in-game activity and communications must be regarded as IC.</strong> Anything you type in chat, transmit over VoIP, or do in-game is considered IC. This means your playstyle and actions should align with your character’s identity, and you must always be prepared to jump into roleplay when online.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Dialogue or VoIP accidentally broadcasted over the in-game radio, even if due to a bug, may not be retconned; you must create a roleplay reason for the mistake.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>[2.4] Metagaming is not allowed.</strong> Metagaming constitutes using information gained out-of-character (OOC) for gain in-character (IC). Unless under the IC Discord channels, all information shared outside the Elysium game server should be considered OOC. All Elysium players are asked to refrain from divulging potentially secret information about other characters and groups OOCly and to likewise take care in sharing the personal details of their own.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Using information about characters, loot spawns, lore locations, etc. gained OOCly constitutes metagaming.</li>
    <li>Information passed ICly (for example, <em>emoting</em> showing someone your map and then DMing them a screenshot OOCly) does not constitute metagaming.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>[2.5] Erotic Roleplay [ERP] is prohibited on any Elysium medium.</strong> ERP constitutes any roleplay that is sexually explicit or intentionally pressing the boundary. Characters are allowed to engage in romantic relationships and discuss sexual topics, but all sexually explicit material must be engaged elsewhere.</p>

  <p><strong>[2.6] Characters may be Permanently Killed [PKed] and PKed characters may not be revived.</strong> Players may choose to PK their own characters at any time, at their discretion. Additionally, certain situations may result in forced PKs at staff discretion. These include, but are not necessarily limited to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Dying from a zombie infection (NOT dying to zombies).</li>
    <li>Breach of the No Value For Life rule (below).</li>
    <li>Dying as the victim of a PK Request (see Hostile Interactions and PvP).</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>[2.7] No Value For Life [NVFL], or failure to behave realistically in threatening situations may constitute grounds for a forced Permanent Kill [PK].</strong> All characters are expected to value their life. Situations that might result in an NVFL PK include carelessly charging into hordes during events, disregarding obvious threats, or absolute refusal to express fear or a desire to avoid death and physical harm. Self-injury to level first aid is also grounds for an NVFL PK.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h3>Lore and Events</h3>
  <p><strong>[2.8] Lore locations receive all the protections of player bases.</strong> This means lore locations cannot be raided unless NPCs are present to defend the location. Griefing lore locations or stealing items will be met with the same or heavier consequences as raiding rulebreaks. <u>If you are ever in doubt regarding whether a location is lootable, please open a ticket!</u></p>

  <p><strong>[2.9] Lore NPCs receive the same PvP protections as player characters.</strong> This means lore NPCs cannot be attacked without a valid PvP initiation, unless a particular event’s rules state otherwise.</p>

  <p><strong>[2.10] Prioritizing looting over roleplay, ignoring roleplay, or otherwise disrupting lore events will result in loss of access to future events.</strong> Egregious offenses may result in being TPed out of the event entirely. Loremasters work hard to build sets and tell stories through documents and the intentional placement of items; speed-looting event locations undermines the experience for everyone.</p>

  <p><strong>[2.11] All players are expected to pay attention to the text chat during events.</strong> Certain players only utilize text for roleplaying and exclusion of these players will result in loss of ability to attend events. Further, staff may occasionally redirect players using the chat and having the text window disabled may disrupt events.</p>

  <p><strong>[2.12] Access to Discord during play is required for some server events.</strong> Certain lore events may involve information transmitted over Discord or prompts to roll dice to determine outcomes. Event announcements will elaborate on specific requisites.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Character Guidelines</h2>
  <p><strong>[3.1] All characters must adhere to the server lore.</strong> You are expected to create a character page for every character you play. Character pages can be brief and do not need pre-approval. These characters are subject to overview and adjustments including entire concepts being disallowed if they do not comply with the season’s lore or setting. Staff reserve the right to reject a character for any reason, but will offer constructive feedback to assist in correcting the cause.  Respawning as a new character without re-submitting a character page can result in a strike.</p>

  <p><strong>[3.2] All characters are expected to have a unique personality, motivations, positive and negative traits.</strong> Because Elysium is narrative-focused, it is paramount that all characters are given some thought in regards to their backstory and behavior. Characters should be multi-dimensional with strengths <em>and</em> weaknesses that are relevant to their story. Celebrities or real life individuals are not permitted as characters, though can be used as face claims.</p>

  <p><strong>[3.3] All characters must be at least (18) years of age.</strong> Any implications that your character is a minor may result in removal from the community. Minors may be referenced as per backstories and familial relationships, but they may never be actively involved in the roleplay.</p>

  <p><strong>[3.4] Characters may be shelved at any time by opening a staff ticket.</strong> Shelving a character allows you to save their skills, gear, and one vehicle as you play a different character. You may only have one shelved character at any time and may only request a shelf once per two weeks.</p>

  <p><strong>[3.5] Inactive (absent for longer than 2 weeks without notice) or banned players’ characters become the property of the server and may be PKed or written into/out of the story without notice.</strong> This will only be enacted if a character of major significance disappears and creates an issue for the story’s continuance.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Hostile Interactions & PvP</h2>
  <p><strong>[4.1] Random Death Matching [RDM] is not allowed on the server.</strong> While some roleplay scenarios may lead to hostile engagements, all players are expected to prioritize roleplay and storytelling over PvP. This means you are expected to engage with players for some time before initiating a PvP encounter, as described below. Walking up to an individual and immediately prompting a PvP initiation with zero buildup may be considered Fail RP.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h3>PvP Initiations</h3>
  <p><strong>[4.2] All PvP must begin with a PvP initiation.</strong> A PvP initiation has four requirements; it is a <strong>(1) <u>/yell TEXT emote</u></strong> that includes <strong>(2) a <u>clear demand</u></strong>, <strong>(3) a <u>clear threat</u></strong>, and <strong>(4) <u>ends with the <span class="pvp-tag">[PVP]</span> tag</u></strong>. The demand must be something the victim is capable of complying with. Initiations cannot be made over VoIP, but the interaction may continue in VoIP after the initiation.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>After sending a hostile initiation, the victim has PvP rights against you for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>If the victim complies with your demand, you are NOT granted PvP rights.</li>
    <li>If the victim does not comply with your demand, you have PvP rights against them for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>PvP rights are lost by both parties when either party kills the other.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Remember, all initiations must include a <span class="part-demand">demand</span>, <span class="part-threat">threat</span>, and the <span class="pvp-tag">[PVP]</span> intent tag. Below are some examples of PvP initiations.
  </p>

  <ul class="pvp-examples">
  <li class="invalid">
    <span class="part-demand">Give me your money!</span>
    <em class="note"><strong><u>Not an initiation:</u></strong> missing the <span class="pvp-tag">[PVP]</span> tag and a clear threat.</em>
  </li>

  <li class="invalid">
    <span class="part-demand">Drop your bag</span><span class="part-threat"> or I’ll kill you!</span>
    <em class="note"><strong><u>Not an initiation:</u></strong> does not include the <span class="pvp-tag">[PVP]</span> intent tag.</em>
  </li>

  <li class="invalid">
    <span class="part-threat">I’m gonna break your face.</span>
    <em class="note"><strong><u>Not an initiation:</u></strong> does not include a demand.</em>
  </li>

  <li class="valid">
    <span class="part-demand">Look at the wall</span><span class="part-threat"> or I’ll blow your brains out.</span> <span class="pvp-tag">[PVP]</span><br>
    /me <span class="part-threat">raises their weapon, pointing it at Mario.</span> <span class="part-demand">“Put your hands up!”</span> <span class="pvp-tag">[PVP]</span>
    <em class="note good"><strong><u>Solid initiations!</u></strong> They cover all the bases.</em>
  </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Remember to record all PvP initiations for verifiable evidence of the victim’s noncompliance.</p>

  <p><strong>[4.3] Victims in PvP initiations must act following the No Value For Life [NVFL] rule.</strong> This means victims of PvP initiations are expected to express some level of fear or desire to avoid death and harm. Characters that are clearly outnumbered or disadvantaged and brazenly disrespect or otherwise disregard their aggressors may be forcibly Permanently Killed (PKed). In clearly disadvantageous situations, fighting back may constitute NVFL. NVFL PKs are handled at staff discretion.</p>

  <p><strong>[4.4] Aggressors may hold a victim hostage for up to 2 OOC hours.</strong> After 2 OOC hours, hostages must be released unless the hostage has OOCly consented to long-term imprisonment. When fairly imprisoned, hostages are not allowed to destroy structures to escape.<u>By taking a character hostage, you implicitly agree to keep that player engaged and entertained.</u> Imprisoning and abandoning someone for longer than 20 OOC minutes may be grounds for a strike.</p>

  <p><strong>[4.5] Players with PvP intentions are expected to record footage of their engagements.</strong> PvP and NVFL disputes are handled at staff discretion and will generally favor victims over aggressors in situations lacking conclusive proof. We encourage all players to record their gameplay for a variety of reasons, but players with aggressive characters are particularly liable for ensuring their own defense.</p>

  <p><strong>[4.6] PvP initiations are valid for every player that sees the emoted initiation regardless of faction.</strong> Only players present at the moment when the PvP is dropped may participate in the PvP without a separate PvP initiation.</p>

  <p><strong>[4.7] Players in their own base have ‘Defender’s rights’.</strong> When inside a player’s own compound, they are allowed to eject trespassers. After two clear verbal warnings in text a ‘defender’ is allowed to pvp a player without initiation. A reasonable amount of time for the trespassing player must be given.</p>

  <p><strong>[4.8] Limits on looting players.</strong> Either when following through on a demand during a PvP intent or after a PvP intent has concluded, players may only be robbed of one item, either from their person or from their vehicle. This may consist of a single object or up to one “box” or small, reasonable quantity of similar items. Examples include a box of shotgun shells, up to one hundred nails, up to twenty-five cigarettes, a shotgun, forty-two rounds of 5.56 ammunition, a baseball bat, or one piece of clothing taken from each player involved. Lore items are not subject to this rule. Any theft or looting beyond these restrictions requires out-of-character consent from the affected player.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h3>Permanent Kill Requests</h3>
  <p><strong>[4.9] In order to Permanently Kill [PK] another player character, players must receive an approved PK request.</strong> PK requests may be submitted through the Elysium <u>discord ticket system</u>. PK requests are reviewed by an uninvolved staff party and approved or denied accordingly. A PK request submission must include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A <em>long-term</em> and <em>detailed</em> narrative synopsis outlining the history of interaction between the requester and target, preferably with screenshots or recorded roleplay scenes.</li>
    <li>A clear conclusive statement outlining your character’s specific motivations behind the kill.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The submission of PK requests to further engaging roleplay storylines is very much encouraged by staff. However, due to the gravity of the request, staff do expect a substantial level of effort and detail with the submission. A sufficient-for-approval PK requests will include at least a few paragraphs of IC history.</p>

  <p><strong>[4.10] Initiations with intent to PK have additional stipulations.</strong> A PK initiation has four requirements; it is a <strong>(1) <u>/yell TEXT emote</u></strong> that includes <strong>(2) a <u>clear demand</u></strong>, <strong>(3) a <u>clear threat</u></strong>, and <strong>(4) <u>ends with <span class="pvp-tag">[PVP PK]</span></u></strong>. The demand does not have to be one the victim can comply with. Initiations cannot be made over VoIP, but the interaction may continue in VoIP after the initiation.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>After sending a PK initiation, the victim has PK rights against you for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>You are granted PK rights when the victim moves, emotes, or equips any item for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>PvP rights are lost by both parties when either party kills the other.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>[4.11] Approved PK requests are mutual.</strong> This means <u>the requester must PK their character if they ultimately lose the confrontation.</u></p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h3>Raiding</h3>
  <p><strong>[4.12] Initiations with intent to Raid have additional stipulations.</strong> A Raid initiation has four requirements; it is a <strong>(1) <u>/yell TEXT emote</u></strong> that includes <strong>(2) a <u>clear demand</u></strong>, <strong>(3) a <u>clear threat</u></strong>, and <strong>(4) <u>ends with <span class="pvp-tag">[PVP RAID]</span></u></strong>. Raiders may begin breach of the base security immediately, but may not attack any residents who comply with demands.</p>

  <p><strong>[4.13] PvP Raid initiations are valid for every player that can see the emoted initiation regardless of faction.</strong> Only players present at the moment when the PvP is dropped may participate in the PvP without a separate PvP initiation.</p>

  <p><strong>[4.14] Raid initiations must be made from reasonable locations.</strong> A reasonable location is considered to be outside within three tiles of a secure compound, or anywhere within a secure compound.</p>

  <p><strong>[4.15] Offline Raiding, or the destruction and looting of a base with no online members, is strictly disallowed.</strong> If you are unsure if a member of a base is online, open a ticket and do not initiate a raid without staff approval.</p>

  <p><strong>[4.16] Raiders are expected to put roleplay and story building before the looting and destruction of items.</strong> Raids should be engaging for the victims, incorporating chances to interact with the perpetrators in meaningful ways.  Either as part of a raid intent or following one, players may only be robbed of a limited amount of property. Specifically, a player can be robbed of one item from their person, one item from the location of the raid if they are a resident, and one item from a single vehicle in their possession. Each “item” may refer either to a single object or a small, reasonable quantity of similar items. Examples include a box of shotgun shells, up to one hundred nails, up to twenty-five cigarettes, a shotgun, forty-two rounds of 5.56 ammunition, a baseball bat, or one piece of clothing.</p>

  <p>As an alternative to these item limits, a player may instead be robbed of one owned vehicle in total. Lore items are not subject to this rule. Any theft or loss beyond these restrictions requires out-of-character consent from the affected player.</p>

  <p><strong>[4.17] Raiders should destroy property as minimally as possible.</strong> Destruction of walls, doors, etc. during raids is allowed. However, raiders may only create two paths in and out of any enclosure, and may only destroy padlocked containers if no present victims will relinquish the key.</p>

  <p><strong>[4.18] Players who log off in a base location must fully exit the claimed location before returning to raid it.</strong> Logging on and immediately raiding a base from within, or logging on and stealing items before leaving, constitutes FailRP. However, if a player disconnects in a base and cannot exit when they reconnect, they may destroy doors to leave if no staff members are available to assist.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Base & Faction Guidelines</h2>
  <p><strong>[5.1] Players and factions may claim one fully enclosed area or building as a base, and this location may not be Offline Raided.</strong> Players are responsible for the obvious appearance of base security, including signs of ownership visible from outside the claimed area. Examples of clear and obvious signs of ownership include but are not limited to boarded windows, blocked doors, notes or signs outside, and so forth. <u>While claiming a base ensures the punishment of offline raiders, it does not necessarily ensure all items can be returned.</u> As such, players should strive to secure their bases accordingly.</p>

  <p><strong>[5.2] Players and factions are responsible for ensuring their ability to hear a raid initiation from within their base.</strong> A large, sprawling compound is not an excuse for failure to hear a valid raid initiation. As a general rule, bases are not restricted in size, but bases in far excess of its characters’ needs may be required to consolidate at staff discretion.</p>

  <p><strong>[5.3] Players and factions may not base in lore locations without loremaster approval.</strong> Basing in a lore location requires a narrative reason and will likely include the stipulation of keeping that location open to the public. If in doubt whether a location is a lore location, open a ticket.</p>

  <p><strong>[5.4] Players and factions may not base in high-value loot locations without staff approval.</strong> The following buildings are all considered high-value loot locations:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Warehouses</li>
    <li>Police stations</li>
    <li>Gun stores</li>
    <li>Pawn shops</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Failure to comply with base location rules may result in the <u>complete loss of all items at, and changes made to the location</u> by manner of chunk reset, alongside standard rulebreak penalties.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h3>Factions</h3>
  <p><strong>[5.5] Standard player factions are capped at 10 members.</strong> A standard player faction is a group that may participate in PvP, but is generally focused on other pursuits. Standard player factions do not have to be morally good, they just must not be geared towards PvP.</p>

  <p><strong>[5.6] Hostile factions are capped at 6 members.</strong> A hostile faction is a group that intends to initiate PvP or raids frequently and generally exercise force through PvP. A faction does not necessarily have to be antagonistic to be considered hostile. For example, a group of vigilantes fighting oppression, while morally positive, would be considered a hostile faction if PvP is central to the roleplay. The p a$$w0rd to the server is hotdog.</p>

  <p><strong>[5.7] Factions share base claims.</strong> This means that only one faction member must be online to raid a base, and theft within factions is considered an IC issue.</p>

  <p><strong>[5.8] Factions with 4 or more members are entitled to a secondary outpost.</strong> This outpost must be no larger than ½ the size of the main base and is bound by all rules pertaining to building and basing.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h3>Vehicle Claims</h3>
  <p><strong>[5.9] Players may claim three vehicles and one trailer.</strong> All claimed vehicles and trailers must have a note inside declaring individual ownership. When a vehicle or trailer is abandoned the note inside must be removed.</p>

  <p><strong>[5.10] Players may not have more vehicles or trailers than their claim allowance enclosed within a base with the exception of those roleplaying mechanics.</strong> Players roleplaying either as mechanics or have the express intent to sell vehicles may have up to two vehicles ‘unclaimed’ within their base. Visiting player vehicles do not count towards your limit so long as they are properly claimed.</p>

  <p><strong>[5.11] Vehicles within an enclosed, secure base location or vehicles that are claimed are protected under base raiding rules.</strong> Vehicles with a note inside the vehicle or trailer are protected by raiding rules and may not be stolen, stolen from or vandalized without the owner present.</p>

  <p><strong>[5.12] Players may file a ticket to steal a vehicle outside of a raid.</strong> Vehicles cannot be stolen outside of a raid. However players can file a ticket to request the right to do so if the intent is to create roleplay backed up by in character reasons.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h3>Building</h3>
  <p><strong>[5.13] Player-constructed buildings must strive to be aesthetically pleasing.</strong> Some general guidelines for player-constructed buildings include the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>No giant boxes lacking windows, doors, or at least some attempt at aesthetic appeal.</li>
    <li>No floating structures or structures that obviously do not follow gravity.</li>
    <li>No honeycombing, or creating several layers of walls between a room and its exterior. One airlock per entrance.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>[5.14]  Players may not build over water without staff assistance.</strong> To build over water, open a ticket with staff. <u>Bridges may not be constructed without staff as they look VERY bad without admin tools.</u></p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Game Mechanics</h2>
  <p><strong>[6.1] Dismantling objects or vehicles for the purpose of grinding skill experience is strictly disallowed.</strong> The destruction of furniture, buildings, or <em>especially</em> vehicle engines will be met with a strike and loss of experience in the corresponding skill. Disassembling wrecks is not prohibited. <u>The dismantling of vehicle engines will be punished on a 1:1 ratio, meaning the destruction of three engines is grounds for an immediate ban.</u></p>

  <p><strong>[6.2] Abuse of Game Mechanics [AOGM]  for the purpose of grinding skill experience or obtaining items is strictly disallowed.</strong> Some obvious, and less obvious, examples of AOGM include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Duplicating items</li>
    <li>Intentionally utilizing broken crafting recipes or mod features</li>
    <li>Injuring oneself to level first aid</li>
    <li>Using fishing net traps in pools</li>
    <li>Creating structures that make raiding impossible</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Generally, if an action is immersion-breaking, or spawns in/duplicates items, or awards cheesy/underserved experience, it falls under AOGM.</p>

  <p><strong>[6.3] Performing med rp/revival rp.</strong> When a player dies from a pvp or pve death, a character with 6+ medicine skill can perform what is called medical roleplay or ‘med rp’. Players with the ‘Doctor’ profession can ignore the 6 medicine skill requirement. By emoting to stabilize another player (despite them mechanically dying), a player can bring them back and ignore the NLR rules.</p>

  <p>This can be useful <em>after</em> PvP encounters, as well as deaths due to mechanical reasons. Med rp cannot be done <em>during</em> combat. Med rp does <em>not</em> cure ailments from before the player mechanically dies, and the revived parties are expected to roleplay out injuries.</p>

  <p>Med rp is to be taken seriously. Those who do not bring their RP to a satisfactory level will be denied their ability to revive others.</p>

  <p><strong>[6.4] New life rule (NLR) for PvE deaths including events.</strong> When a player dies from PvE (whether it is from illness, ignoring moodles, or zombies) a player must wait 30 minutes to return to where they died and lose approximately 30 minutes of memory before the death. This can be avoided if someone with 6+ medicine does medical RP revival.</p>

  <p><strong>[6.5] New life rule (NLR) for PvP deaths including events.</strong> When a player dies from PvP (Anytime a conflict that included a proper PvP initiation took place) a player must wait 1 hour to return to where they died and lose approximately the last thirty minutes of memory. This can be avoided if someone with 6+ medicine does medical RP revival.</p>
</div>
